August 2021, Jorrit Mesman

## Description
This workshop gives an introduction to the R package <strong>data.table</strong>. This package provides an extension to data.frame and focuses on fast data handling. 
Additionally, it supports a clear and concise syntax. 

Website of data.table: https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/

## Outline
- Introductory presentation
- R script walkthrough (basic and advanced data.table usage)
- Questions & Exercises

## Instructions before the workshop
Have a working R setup and clone this repository. We'll use the "Workshop script.R" for the walkthrough and the files in the "data" folder. 

Although this workshop is just about data.table and you don't need additional packages to use it, I use a few additional packages in the walkthrough script to make this
workshop more applicable to limnology. So please install the following packages before coming to the workshop ( install.packages("package_name") ):
- data.table
- rLakeAnalyzer
- ggplot2
- lubridate
